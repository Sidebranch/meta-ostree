# meta-ostree
BitBake meta data layer for Yocto / OpenEmbedded Core, adding update functionality using libostree (OSTree)

Keep track of upcoming changes in the Issues section of the GitHub project, as we plan to make the integration even cleaner using DISTRO_FEATURES rather than distro. This will affect the configuration of your Yocto / OpenEmbedded project.
